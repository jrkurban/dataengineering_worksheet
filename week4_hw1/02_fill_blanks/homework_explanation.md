## Question  

- Use this dataset: `all_anonymized_2015_11_2017_03.csv` in `https://github.com/erkansirin78/datasets/raw/master/personal-cars-classifieds.zip `

- There is an Spark application in main.py which transforms the data and writes it in hive`test1.cars_cleaned` as orc format.

- All transformations happen in `utility.my_helpers` module. In this module methods are empty, and you are expected to write defined transformation in each method.

- Submit main.py and see the result table in hive.
